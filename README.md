# Kick It Out
This project is about creating personal blog website. I decided to create a blog about football, groundhopping and Legia Warszawa.

## Running the project
To run the project you just need to download it completely and open index.html file in a web browser.

## Home Page
The Home Page was divided into the following sections:
- Header - containing football image and title of the blog
- Navigation bar - containing links to all main pages
- Side Navigation Bar - containing quick links to some of the pages
- Content panel - containing links to the other pages
- Footer - containing information about used resources

## Blog Post
each blog post was built up with the same structure. The only difference is the content of the Content Panel. There a real content for each blog post was added.

## Styling
